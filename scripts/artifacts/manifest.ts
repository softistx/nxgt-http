/**
 * What a published tarball may not contain, measured on Bun 1.4.0 rather than
 * assumed:
 *
 *   - a `link:` or `file:` in a field a consumer installs. `devDependencies`
 *     are exempt: a consumer never installs a dependency's dev dependencies,
 *     so a `link:` there is untidy, not harmful.
 *   - a **required** peer that is on no registry. This is the shape that once
 *     broke every consumer's install of nxgt-core with a 404. An *optional*
 *     peer is safe whatever its range; a required one is not.
 *   - an **exact pin on a sibling package**. `workspace:*` publishes as the
 *     exact version, so `@nxgt/openapi-httpyz` would demand the exact
 *     `@nxgt/httpyz` it was built with while the consumer's own caret range
 *     resolved to a newer one: two copies in one tree, and two
 *     `ValidationError` classes. `workspace:^` publishes
 *     as a caret range, which dedupes.
 *   - a **sibling range that excludes the sibling being published beside it**.
 *     `workspace:^` is substituted from `bun.lock`, not from the sibling's
 *     `package.json`, so a `changeset version` that is not followed by a
 *     `bun install` publishes yesterday's numbers. This repository was carrying
 *     that exact staleness on 2026-09-22: PR #46 released
 *     `@nxgt/openapi-nuxt@0.3.0` and left `bun.lock` saying `0.2.1`. Nothing
 *     shipped wrong only because no sibling depends on `openapi-nuxt`. In
 *     `nxgt-core` the same shape put `@nxgt/shared-graphql@2.0.0` on npm asking
 *     for `@nxgt/security@^3.2.1` while its `dist` imported the 4.0.0 API: the
 *     install succeeds, the types check, and the consumer quietly gets both
 *     majors. Every range involved is a well-formed caret, which is why nothing
 *     else notices.
 *   - a **package that lists itself** in a field a consumer installs. Neither
 *     of the checks above sees it: `@nxgt/material` shipped
 *     `"@nxgt/material": "."` for four months, and `.` is neither a `file:`
 *     prefix nor a digit. It is not inert — `.` resolves to the *consumer's*
 *     directory, so every install grew a second copy of the package reporting
 *     the consumer's own version, plus a `bun.lock` entry no manifest declared
 *     and `bun install` kept re-creating. A package self-references through its
 *     `name` and `exports`; it never needs to depend on itself.
 *   - a **license other than MIT, or no `LICENSE` in the tarball**. npm only
 *     ships the `LICENSE` in the package's own directory, never the root's.
 *   - **test code**: a `*.spec.*`, a `*.test.*`, a snapshot, or a
 *     `<subject>.fixtures.*` file.

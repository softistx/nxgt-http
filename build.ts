/**
 * The build for every package in this workspace.
 *
 * Each package runs `bun run ../../build.ts` from its own directory. There is
 * one script rather than one per package because the packages differ only in
 * their entry points, which they declare themselves under `nxgt.entrypoints`.
 *
 * Two outputs, from two tools:
 *
 *   - JavaScript, from `Bun.build` with `packages: 'external'`. A library must
 *     not bundle its dependencies: `@nxgt/openapi-httpyz` bundling its own
 *     copy of `@nxgt/httpyz` would give an app two `ValidationError` classes,
 *     and an `instanceof` that fails for one of them.
 *   - Declarations, from `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` against
 *     `tsconfig.build.json`, which excludes the `*.spec.ts` files that
 *     `tsconfig.json` still typechecks.
 *
 * Hand-written `.d.ts` files are copied, not emitted: tsc passes them through
 * untouched, so an ambient module augmentation would otherwise never reach
 * `dist/`, and what it declares would vanish for every consumer.
